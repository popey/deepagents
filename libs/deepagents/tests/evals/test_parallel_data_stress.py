"""Eval tests for data-heavy parallel subagent stress scenarios.

Tests the supervisor agent's ability to coordinate many concurrent subagents,
each returning noisy/complex data, and synthesize correct answers from the
combined results.

Six scenarios with increasing difficulty:

1. Extreme noisy extraction (port of JS Eval E)
2. Full-dataset aggregation
3. Cross-referencing between subagent result sets
4. Contradictions between subagents
5. High parallelism (25 concurrent subagents)
6. Temporal ordering sensitivity

# 11 regions x 8 suppliers = 88 total. Dense wall-of-text prose with

#
# Ground truth:
#   1. Highest audited units_produced: Pacifica Alloys (487,200)
#      Runner-up: Nordic Forge (486,800) — difference of 400 units
#      Trap: Pacifica's trade journal figure is 489,000
#
#   2. Lowest defect rate (defects / audited units_produced):

#      Runner-up: Rhine Components: 98 / 334,500 = 0.000293
#      Trap: Helvetia's prior-year defects were 89 (lower, wrong year)
